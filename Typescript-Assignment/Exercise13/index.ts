let favorite_transportation = ["Aeroplane",	"Boat" ,"motorcycle", "Car"]
console.log(`I would like to own a ${favorite_transportation[0]}`);
console.log(`I would like to own a ${favorite_transportation[1]}`);
console.log(`I would like to own a Honda ${favorite_transportation[2]}`);
console.log(`I would like to own a ${favorite_transportation[3]}`);
